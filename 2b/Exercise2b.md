*Exercise: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Define three time-dependent KPIs that you would include in
 a dashboard for the hub operator. These KPIs must provide an immediate overview of the current
 hub operation and how it is doing in terms of utilization or other business-related aspects. Briefly
 explain the rationale behind selecting each KPI, explain why you have chosen it and, where
 needed, provide references. Calculate hourly values for the selected KPIs and visualize them over
 time. Which trends do you observe? How do you explain them?*


1. **Utilization Rate of Charging Stations**: 
Percentage showing station usage over specific periods (e.g., hourly). 
Indicates peak demand times and overall station effectiveness.

2. **Average kWh per Session**: 
The typical energy delivered per charging session. 
Provides insight into user charging habits and session capacity requirements.

3. **Average Session Duration**: 
The average time vehicles remain connected. 
Helps operators plan capacity and consider dynamic pricing strategies.
